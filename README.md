# BaldurBird
Open OpenGL API for C#. This project focuses on implementing OpenGL for C# to make it friendly and easy to use. 
The project is not intended to be closed and will allow you to implement your own elements. 
Ultimately, the project will be cross-platform.

## Introduction
This project has been following me for a long time.
I know that there are many libraries written for OpenGL and for example in C/C++ they will be much more efficient.
But I'm still missing something "personal", some understanding...? I want everyone who uses this project to say "this is it... This is what I was looking for".
